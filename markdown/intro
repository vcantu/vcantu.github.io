I'm Viviano and I am a senior at **Northeastern University** majoring in Computer Science and Marketing. I'll be working for **Amazon Robotics** after I graduate in 2019.

I love developing software, especially mobile apps and websites. I've been coding since I was a freshman in high school. This page includes my work experience and some projects I have worked on since I started.
