This is my pride and joy. I have been working on this app since September of 2014. I always found the idea of QWERTY keyboards on touchscreens backwards. Since I had some Java experience I decided to jump in and try it for myself. 

The keyboard consists of six areas, five outer ones and one inner. Each area is composed of one main, tappable, key and various other, swipeable, keys. Because every key is a unique gesture there it is much harder to make mistakes. 

Because of it's compact design, NovaKey includes many useful features that most generic QWERTY keyboards don't have. These include:
* Resizeable and movable
* The ability to move the cursor
* The ability to copy, cut, paste & select/deselect all text
* All the special keys you may need
* Customizable with many colors and themes
